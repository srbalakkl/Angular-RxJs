<h2>Memory Leaks</h2>

<p>
  A memory leak occurs when allocated memory is no longer needed but not released,
  leading to memory consumption that grows over time.
  In Angular, memory leaks often happen when components or other objects are not properly disposed of,
  preventing the garbage collector from reclaiming memory.
